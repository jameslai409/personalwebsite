                However, if you don't get fed you are very subject to unbelievable tilt.</h5>

                    <h1 class="center">Item Build</h1>
                    <p class="center">For the majority of the time, you should leave base with boots and 4 health potions.
                    You don't do well with Doran's Ring because you don't use mana, and if you go Doran's Shield, you won't have enough HP Potions to survive laning phase.
                    A great alternate is Cloth Armor, especially when you are playing against a poke heavy AD champion like Jayce.
                    Simple Cheatsheet: Boots against AP, Cloth against AD.

                    <br><br>First item should always be Hextech Gunblade, it adds so much to your burst and your 100-0 kill potential.
                    You get a MASSIVE powerspike when you get this item. If you get it early, consider the bot lane swap, which I'll mention later.

                    <br><br>Next item will either be Zhonyas or Lich Bane. Zhonyas is a nice all-round item that is very good in general, since you'll be constantly diving. However, Lich Bane is infinitely more funner to get second in my opinion, because it adds to much more to your burst. If you want to climb, get Zhonyas. If you want fun, get Lich Bane.

                    <br><br>Other items are Abysall Scepter if their team comp is AP heavy, Rabadons for more AP, Sorcerer Shoes, and Void Staff if they are tanky. Skip void staff if they have no tanks, because you'll stuff be able to 100-0 many squishies without it.</p>

                    <p class="center">Simple.
                    <br><br>If you get a early gunblade, tell your bot lane to lane swap with whatever lane you are in, top or mid.
                    <br><br>If they tell you to fuck off, walk into their lane anyways via a gank and kill their ADCs. They shouldn't be able to handle your full combo with Ignite and Gunblade.
                    <br><br>Just stay bot and constantly push, diving the ADC and/or support whenever they come back to lane.
